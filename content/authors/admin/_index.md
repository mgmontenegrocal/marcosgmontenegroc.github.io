bio: ​​I am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Glasgow. I recently completed an internship at the Deutsche Bundesbank in the Monetary Policy Strategy Section. 
     
     I contributed to the teams's analytical and policy work by enhancing the DSGE model used to analyse questions about monetary policy, integrating components of an open economy.

     I will be on the job market in 2024/2025, seeking roles in a dynamic environment where I can make a positive impact on meaningful projects.
