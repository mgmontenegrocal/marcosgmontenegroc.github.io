title: "A Diagnostic TANK Model for the Housing Market"
abstract: Quantities and prices in the US housing market exhibit a puzzling excess volatility. I argue that the expectations channel not only is relevant but also serves as a key factor in solving this puzzle. In this paper, I incorporate diagnostic expectations as an amplification mechanism in a TANK model featuring a housing and banking sector. I estimate the model using Sequential Monte Carlo methods. The results indicate that, contingent on whether agents' imperfect memory is driven by the immediate past or the last three years, the diagnostic model relies on less volatile shocks. Specifically, the size of the housing preference shock is found to be two thirds or less compared to rational expectations. This implies that diagnostic expectations is accounting for approximately at least a third of what Iacoviello and Neri (2010) describe as either “genuine shifts in tastes for housing, or a catchall for all the unmodeled disturbances that can affect housing demand” (p. 150). Moreover, if I shut down the expectations channel -i.e. when agents are rational- the model fails generate the excess volatility in house prices observed in the data.
